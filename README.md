# LED-morse-code

__Brief Description__  
This project uses an Arduino to translate english to morse code. You input words into the Serial Monitor, then it outputs the morse code equivalent and makes the LED blink.  
If you are going to use this please set the Serial Monitor's baud rate to 9600 and have your jumper wire connected to pin13/change the code to your matching pin.
